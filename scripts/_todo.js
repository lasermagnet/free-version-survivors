```

# todo
- remove "items" ruleset, use upgrades
- second weapon (triangle stuff)
- add thick border to the level, inside layout (increase size)
- audio
- waves (with string names/labels)
- enemy types: advanced spawning (formations etc)
- more weapons
- stat upgrades: health regen
- game over screen
- split upgrades: buffs & debuffs

# maybe
- restructure weapons so their behaviours are modifiable (not just properties)
